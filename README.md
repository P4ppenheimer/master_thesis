# Circle Slice Flows and the Variational Determinant Estimator
This repository contains my master thesis in the field of Normalizing Flows which was prepared during 2020 at the University of Amsterdam. The codebase can be found in my [other repositor](https://github.com/P4ppenheimer/circle_slice_flow_and_variational_determinant_estimator).
